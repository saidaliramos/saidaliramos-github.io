There are no formal rules, there is no timer, no way to measure yards, no 1st and ten, but everyone is having fun, and that is what matters. The game will last for one, two, or even three hours; who knows, and moreover, who cares! Do you get the picture? Ok, now let's get to the main point of this article." }

Nothing happens if your team wins or loses; it's all just for having a good time with friends, or even making new friends. In the business environment the goal is quite different; it's all about delivering value to the customer. Yes, the IT organization serves a business that needs to be profitable, beat competitors and deliver quality services to its customers. And it happens that as digital transformation advances, the role of IT in supporting those goals is more and more important each day." },

ITSM is the framework that dictates how the IT game is played with the goal of delivering value to your customer." }
